# Flipkart GRiD â€“ Te[a]ch The Machines | 2019

This years challenge was on Object Localization in images.More specifically we had to find the bounding box prediction around an object in  in an image.There was only single object in an image.

Given an image we had to predict the coordinates of the bounding box around the object in that image.During testing the Intersection over union (IOU) was calculated to check the performance of the model.

The original size of image was very high so it was scaled down and greyscaled before training.

# Training Set
It consisted of the image and corresponding coordinates of the bounding box around the object.
Here is the link to the training images which is saved as pickle file due to its large size.
The images were scaled down to size 64X64 before saving to a pickle file

Training set csv file containg the coordinates of the images after being rescaled.

# Test Set
The images were saved and uploaded as a pickle file on drive and them later used in code.

The test images were also resized to 64X64


We have used keras library which uses tenserflow in backend
We created a custom neural net having the following layers

# ModelSummary:-


Inspired by VGG-16 with some hyperparameter tuning

We used the 'mse'(L2) loss function , optimizer = adadelta and the trained the network for 100 epochs.
Finally we saved the results into test.csv file

We got an accuracy of around 87% on the test data
